# Cyclistic-Bike-Share

#Scenario
#You are a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, your team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.

#Please note that data-privacy issues prohibited me from using riders’ personally identifiable information. This means that I  wasn’t able to connect pass purchases to credit card numbers to determine if casual riders live in the Cyclistic service area or if they have purchased multiple single passes. 

#After compoeteing my analysis, this helped me draw conclusions that annual members of this service take more frequent rides however seem to ride for shorter amounts of time, whereas casual riders are less frequent but take longer rides. 

#Casual riders may end up buying a Cyclistic annual membership if there were more incentive to do so. Such as a sale during certain times of the year, or shorter memberships to purchase if this rider is only visiting the area for a shorter amount of time. Maybe offer a free trial to first time riders.
